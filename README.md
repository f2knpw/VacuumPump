How to reuse a fridge compressor to build a vacuum pump for RC planes wings carbon or fiber glass laminate

Fiberglass Composites provide unique and valuable benefits, from high strength-to-weight ratios, relatively low cost, durability, chemical, water and abrasion resistance all in one.

However  the mechanical properties and performances are highly dependent on composite production conditions under which they are produced, from hand lay-up to vacuum bagging. 

This project will focus on vacuum bagging process and show how to reuse a cheap refrigerator compressor as the main vacuum pump.
